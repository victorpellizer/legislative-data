1. Discuss your strategy and decisions implementing the application. Please, consider time
complexity, effort cost, technologies used and any other variable that you understand
important on your development process.
-> The application is developed fully on Pure Python, no external libraries were needed.
I focused on bringing together the information from all CSVs by comparing the rows' IDs,
resulting in reliable dicts of information, then I just printed it the way it was asked.

2. How would you change your solution to account for future columns that might be
requested, such as “Bill Voted On Date” or “Co-Sponsors”?
-> In this case, I would just add another index to the bill dict I created.

3. How would you change your solution if instead of receiving CSVs of data, you were given a
list of legislators or bills that you should generate a CSV for?
-> Generating CSV files is quite simple and can be done without any external libraries. Honestly,
it's easier to generate a CSV file than a readable HTML file.

4. How long did you spend working on the assignment?
-> About 1 and a half hours to solve the questions, and another 1 hour to decide which way was
the best to present it. In the end, the presentation isn't lovely.
